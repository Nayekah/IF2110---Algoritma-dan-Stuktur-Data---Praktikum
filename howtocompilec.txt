first, make sure to install c compiler

then do in terminal (ignore the '[]') :

gcc [ADT1.c ADT2.c ...] solver.c -o destinationfile

example:
in praktikum 02, i want to test kekayaan.c, then, do :

gcc liststatik.c solver.c -o result (you can change the "result" part as you like)



to run, do :
./result (or your binary file name)
